Hey there 👋,
</p>
I am currently a year one PhD student in Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. My research interest lies everywhere Statistics and Machine Learning help me to know this world better. Still struggling in learning html, hopefully soon all my notes taken in Google Docs will be moved to this page for share. I am composed 30 percent of a cat lover 🐈💕, 30 percent being musical maniac 🎼☠️ , 30 percent being addicted to reading ⭐🧠 and 10 percent intentionally left blank 😉.

### Don't Call the Cat Angel 💗

I love cats. Once adopted two of them in my childhood. They are mysterious, cute, fierce, kind of sexy and so am I 🩰😘. Basically, I find all kinds of cats are fanscinating but Skogkatt is my new sweetheart recently. Collecting pics and videos of cats helps me to refreshe the mentally and physically draining PhD life. Thanks to these angels. Oops, my bad, they are Satans 👼😈.

### Ashley vs. Halsey 🦄
Same with Halsey, one of my favorite singers, the manic interlude in depression is my friend. I do believe that melancholy exists in the state of its poetic name 'The Black Liquid'. Do not know whether it's fairy or witch's magic elixir. But it helps me think. 'Covered in the colors pull apart at the seams', I feel the world cannot be more true as it is. Other bands and singers I am into include Rammstein, Ghost, Lana Del Rey, Crystal Castle, Twenty One Pilots and Kent, etc.

### My Story with Finland ❄️
Moi! Moi! I was in Finland in 2019 for the semester exchange. Turku is the city where I spent the most happy and memorable four months in my life. Hope to visit Finland again after the Covid-19 Pandemic. 

Other countries I visited in Europe are Sweden, Norway, Iceland, Baltic States, Czechia, Germany, Belgium and Italy. Cinnamon rolls and Glögg kind of saved my life in the dark and cold nights in Nordic Countries.
