Hey there 👋,
</p>
I am currently a year one PhD student in Hong Kong University of Sicence and Technology. My research interest lies in everywhere Statistics and Machine Learning can help me to know this world better. Still struggling in learning html but soon all my notes taken in Google docs will be moved to this page for share. I am composed 30 percent of a cat lover 🐈💕, 30 percent musical maniac 🎼☠️ , 30 percent addicted to reading ⭐🧠.

### Don't Call the Cat Angel

I love cats. Once adopted two of them when I was still in the childhood. They are mysterious, cute, fierce, kind of sexy and so am I 🩰😘. Collecting pics and videos of cats helps me to refreshe the mentally and physically draining PhD life. Thanks to these angels. Oops, my bad, they are satans 👼😈.

### Ashley vs. Halsey
Same with Halsey, one of my favorite singer, the manic interludes in depression is my friend. I do believe that melancholy exists in the state of its poetic name 'The Black Liquid'. Donnot know whether it's fairy or witch's magic elixir. But it helps me on thinking. 'Covered in the colors pull apart at the seams', I just feel that I do have been to this world. Other bands and singers I am in includes Rammstein, Ghost, Lana Del Rey, Crystal Castle, twenty one pilots and Kent, etc.

### My Story with Finland ❄️
Moi! Moi! I was in Finland in 2019 for the semester exchange. Turku is the city where I spent the most happy and memorable four months in my life. Hope to visit Finland again after the Covid-19 Pandemic. 

Countries I visited in Europe are Finland, Sweden, Norway, Iceland, Baltic States, Czechia, Germany and Italy. Cinnamon rolls and Glog kind of saved my life during the dark and cold nights in Nordic Countries.
