Hey there 👋,
</p>
I am currently a year one PhD student in Hong Kong University of Sicence and Technology. My research interest lies in everywhere Statistics and Machine Learning can help me to know this world better. Still struggling in learning html but soon all my notes taken in Google docs will be moved to this page for share. I am composed 30 percent of a cat lover 🐈💕, 30 percent musical maniac 🎼☠️ , 30 percent addicted to reading ⭐🧠.

### Don't Call the Cat Angel

I love cats. Adopted two of them in my childhood. They are mysterious, cute, fierce, kind of sexy and so as I am 🩰😘. Collecting pics and videos of cats refreshes the mentally and physically draining PhD life. Thanks to these angels. Oops, my bad, they are satans 👼😈.
