Hey there 👋,
</p>
I obtained my PhD in Mathematics at HKUST in 2025. My research focuses on synthetic data (applied to e.g. AI driven healthcare) and differential privacy (more recently, privacy and security in LLM). I am 50 percent of a cat person 🐈💕, 40 percent being musical maniac 🎼☠️ and 10 percent intentionally left blank 😉. Music helps me to think. I am into Rammstein, Till Lindemann, Twenty One Pilots, Lana Del Rey and Kent.

### Don't Call the Cat Angel 💗

I love cats and raised two. The videos of cats in Tiktok help me to survive from my PhD life. Thanks to these angels. Oops, my bad, they are Satans 👼😈.

### My Story with Finland ❄️
Moi! Moi! I spent my one semester in Finland in 2019. Turku witnessed the happiest four months in my life. 

Other countries I visited are Sweden, Norway, Iceland, Baltic States, Czechia, Germany, France, Belgium, Italy and the US. Cinnamon rolls and Glögg kind of saved my life in the dark and cold nights in Nordic Countries.
